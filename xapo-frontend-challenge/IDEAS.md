# Potential Improvements

## User Experience

1. **Form Feedback**

   - Improve the loading state on the Confirm button for better visual clarity and user confidence.

2. **Error Handling**

   - Rewrite error messages to be more user-friendly and descriptive—clear over clever.
   - Preserve form data when an error occurs to avoid frustrating re-entry.

3. **Accessibility**

   - Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements to improve screen reader support.
   - Ensure focus management is intentional and predictable.
   - Enable full keyboard navigation across all form elements.
   - Test with screen readers to confirm real-world accessibility, not just checkbox compliance.

4. **Mobile Experience**

   - Improve form responsiveness so layout and elements behave correctly on all screen sizes.
   - Optimize input behaviors (like keyboard types and spacing) for mobile usability.

## Technical Improvements

1.  **Optimize Re-renders**

    - Wrap CurrencyInput in React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    - Memoize handlers like handleAmountChange using useCallback to improve render stability.
    - Memoize expensive calculations (e.g. formatted balance)

2.  **Input Handling**
    - Debounce amount input changes to avoid excessive updates and API calls.
    - Improve validation messages to clearly guide the user when something’s off.

## Features

1. **Transaction History**

   - Add a simple list of past transactions—transparency builds trust.
   - Include key transaction details: type, amount, and date.
   - Allow basic filtering for better navigation of past activity.

2. **User Preferences**

   - Save preferred currency (e.g. localStorage).
   - Remember last used amounts for a smoother return experience.
   - Add basic settings for user control and preference management.

## Code Quality

1. **TypeScript**

   - Add proper interfaces for props across components.
   - Add strong typing for internal state.
   - Add proper enums for constants to improve clarity and safety.

2. **Styling**

   - Consider migrating to CSS Modules to prevent style conflicts.
   - Improve responsive design with clearer media queries and consistent spacing.

3. **Development**

   - Configure ESLint rules for consistent code quality.
   - Add Git hooks (like lint-staged) to catch issues before they hit the repo.
