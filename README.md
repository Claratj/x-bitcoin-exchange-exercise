# Front-End Engineer Take-Home Challenge

Welcome! This challenge is designed to give you an opportunity to showcase your front-end development skills, particularly in areas relevant to creating engaging and user-friendly interfaces, similar to what we build here. We're excited to see what you create!

This task focuses on your ability to blend technical proficiency with a strong sense of user experience, animation, and visual design â€“ skills crucial for roles involving marketing and user-facing applications.

## The Task: BTC <> USD Exchange Interface

Your goal is to create a single-page application (SPA) that simulates a simple cryptocurrency exchange interface for swapping between Bitcoin (BTC) and US Dollars (USD).

**Core Functionality:**

1.  **Swap Mechanism:** The interface should allow users to easily switch between:
    * Buying BTC (spending USD)
    * Selling BTC (receiving USD)
2.  **Input Fields:** Users should be able to input the amount they want to exchange (either in BTC or USD).
3.  **Exchange Rate Display:** Display the current BTC/USD exchange rate.
    * *Optionally*, you can fetch a real-time rate from an API (like CoinDesk: `https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json`, or others). Using a static rate for simplicity is also perfectly acceptable.
4.  **Dynamic Calculation:** When the user inputs an amount in one currency, the corresponding amount in the other currency should be calculated and displayed based on the exchange rate.
5.  **Confirmation Step:** Include a clear "Confirm Swap" or similar action button.
6.  **Success State:** After the user confirms the transaction, display a clear "Success" confirmation message or transition to a success state/view.

## Key Focus Areas

While functionality is important, we are particularly interested in your execution in these areas:

1.  **User Experience (UX):**
    * Is the interface intuitive and easy to use?
    * Are the steps clear?
    * Does the flow feel smooth?
    * Are potential user errors handled gracefully (e.g., basic validation)?
2.  **Animations & Visual Appeal:**
    * Implement thoughtful animations that enhance the user experience, not detract from it.
    * Pay attention to visual design, layout, typography, and overall aesthetic pleasantness.
    * **Examples of animations to consider:**
        * Interactive button states (hover, active, disabled).
        * Smooth transitions when the calculated amounts update.
        * Subtle animations on input focus/validation.
        * An engaging visual effect for the "Success" confirmation.
3.  **Code Quality & Architecture:**
    * Write clean, readable, and maintainable JavaScript/TypeScript code.
    * Demonstrate a good understanding of component-based architecture (e.g., using React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or even well-structured vanilla JS components).
    * Use modern CSS techniques effectively (e.g., CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS, BEM, clean plain CSS).

## Technical Considerations

* **Framework/Library:** You are free to use any modern front-end framework/library (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.) or vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript. Choose what you are most comfortable and productive with. We use Next/React in most of our products.
* **Styling:** Use any styling approach you prefer.
* **State Management:** Use appropriate state management for the complexity of the task.
* **Integration Knowledge (Context):** While this task doesn't require implementing actual CMS or Analytics integration, keep in mind that experience with such integrations is valuable for the role. Structure your components in a way that *could* theoretically accommodate such integrations later.

## Deliverables

1.  **Source Code:** Provide a link to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) containing your complete source code.
2.  **Running Instructions:** Include clear instructions in your repository's README (or a separate `HOWTO.md`) on how to install dependencies and run the project locally.
3.  **(Optional but Recommended):** Create IDEAS.md and provide list of possible improvements (also non technical if you want!)

## Evaluation Criteria

We will evaluate your submission based on:

* **Completion:** Does the application fulfill the core functional requirements?
* **UX/UI:** How intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing is the interface?
* **Animations:** Quality and effectiveness of the animations used.
* **Code Quality:** Readability, structure, maintainability, and use of best practices in JS/TS and CSS.
* **Component Architecture:** How well is the application structured into components?
* **Attention to Detail:** Overall polish and execution.

## Tips for Success

* **Focus on the Core:** Ensure the main requirements are met before adding extra features.
* **Showcase Your Strengths:** Use the technologies and techniques you know best.
* **Creativity Encouraged:** Feel free to add your own creative touches, especially regarding UX and animations.
* **Keep it Clean:** Prioritize clean code and clear structure.
* **Think About the User:** Put yourself in the user's shoes throughout the design and development process.
* **Don't Overcomplicate:** Build what's required and showcase your skills effectively within that scope.
